I also closely work with my friends [Bingcong Li](https://bingcongli.github.io) and [Huozhi Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nHKsiE0AAAAJ&hl=en). <br>
My current research focuses on: <br>
- **Machine Learning**: Multi-armed (contextual) bandits with its applications for recommendation systems and social
networks; Graph neural nets; <br>
- **Optimization**: Acceleration for convex optimization; Stochastic optimization for large-scale optimization problems; <br>
- **Signal/Data Processing**: Computational imaging; Spectral shrinkage based data completion.

Nice to e-meet you! I am Lingda Wang, a fourth-year Ph.D. student at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu), advised by [Prof. Zhizhen Zhao](http://zhizhenz.ece.illinois.edu). <br>
I received my bachelor's degree from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) in 2017 and master's degree from [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu) at 2020. <br>
My current research focuses on the theory and applications of Machine Learning, Signal/Imgae Processing, Optimization and Data Science. Email address: lingdaw2 AT illinois.edu
